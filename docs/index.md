# Welcome!

**Welcome to the official Wiki for [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry)!** This site is still very limited, and under construction. You can view progress in the GitHub repository for the project. However, there is no longer a roadmap.

**Contribution is highly encouraged.** If you find anything in the game that is not listed in these articles and would like to help, please feel free to hop onto the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MindustryGame/wiki) and open a Pull Request with the changes. If you are new to Markdown, I **strongly** advise you to visit this [beautiful guide](https://commonmark.org/help/) by CommonMark. It has a tutorial (Click "Try our 10-minute Markdown Tutorial") to help you learn Markdown, and a quick reference for the most important aspects of Markdown.

*To get started with Mindustry, head on over to [here](GettingStarted.md)!*
